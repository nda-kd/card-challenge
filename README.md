# Project: card-challenge

I found this challenge [here](https://github.com/ronashco/reactjs-card-challenge) and I tried it :relaxed:
In this challenge, I developed a reactJS responsive web application which
shows a random card on the page and has a button. Whenever the user
clicks on the button, it show another card. (Order of the cards does not
matter).Also user is able to edit the title and description text on the cards
and save it locally.
#####Technologies include:
Html-css, React, ES6, Redux, Axios, Scss, Material-ui-react

## features:
* Shows a random card on the screen when you press the "TRY" button
* Cards shown in different themes (base on their tags)
* Sound Card plays a sound when the card is shown
* Application state and data, fetched from the server, should be managed by Redux
* edit the title and description text on the cards and save it locally
